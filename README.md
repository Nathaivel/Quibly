### Quibly
A simple social media app I made to learn backend amd auth
and Express js
The architecture of the app is messy

#### What you should expect ðŸ˜…
- Messy architecture
- No css (Mostly)
- No UX flow
- Not even proper backend flow

**These are like todo lists for me**

This app was made solely to understand how backend
in social media works and how authentication works

#### Running

There aint many options if you wanna run this app just execute

```bash
$ node index
```
